# Spaced Repetition Tracker Project

A simple web app to help you track topics for learning with the spaced repetition method.

**[➡️ Live Demo](https://spaced-repetition-trackerproject.netlify.app/)**

## What It Does

This tool lets you add a topic you are learning and a start date. It then automatically creates a schedule of future review dates for you.

This helps you know exactly when to review each topic to learn it effectively.

## Main Features

- **Select a User:** Manage different study lists for different users.
- **Add Topics:** Add a new topic and choose a start date.
- **Auto-Schedule:** Creates 5 review dates for each topic (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, etc.).
- **Agenda View:** Shows your upcoming topics sorted by date.
- **Delete Items:** Easily remove topics you no longer need to track.
- **Saves Your Data:** Your agenda is saved in your browser, so it's there when you come back.
- **Accessible:** Easy to use for everyone.
